A graph is $k$-critical if it is $k$-chromatic but each of its proper
induced subgraphs is ($k-1$)-colorable.  It is known that the number
of $4$-critical $P_5$-free graphs is finite, but there is an infinite
number of $k$-critical $P_5$-free graphs for each $k \geq 5$.  We show
that the number of $k$-critical $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free graphs is
finite for every fixed $k$.  Our result implies the existence of a
certifying algorithm for $k$-coloring $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free
graphs.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Graph coloring is a well-studied problem in computer science and
discrete mathematics.  Determining the chromatic number of a graph
is a NP-hard problem.  But for many classes of graphs, such as
perfect graphs, the problem can be solved in polynomial time.
Recently, much research has been done on coloring $P_5$-free
graphs.  Finding the chromatic number of a $P_5$-free graphs is
NP-hard \cite{KraKra2001}, but for every fixed $k$, the problem of
coloring a graph with $k$ colors admits a polynomial-time
algorithm \cite{HoaKam2008, HoaKam2010}.  Research has also been
done on ($P_5, \overline{P}_5$)-free graphs (graphs without $P_5$
and its complement $\overline{P}_5$).  In \cite{GiaRus1997}, a
polynomial-time algorithm is found for finding an approximate
weighted coloring of a ($P_5, \overline{P}_5$)-free graph
(definitions not given here will be given later).  Recently,
\cite{HoaLaz2013} gave a polynomial time algorithm for finding a
minimum weighted coloring of a ($P_5, \overline{P}_5$)-free graph.

The algorithms in \cite{HoaKam2008, HoaKam2010, HoaLaz2013} produce a
$k$-coloring if the input graph is $k$-colorable.  However, when the
graph is not, the algorithms do not produce an easily verified
certificate for a ``NO'' answer.  The point of view in this article is
motivated by the idea of a ``certifying algorithm''.  An algorithm is
{\it certifying} if it returns with each output a simple and easily
verifiable certificate that the particular output is correct.  For
example, a certifying algorithm for the bipartite graph recognition
would return either a 2-coloring of the input graph, thus proving that
it is bipartite, or an odd cycle, thus proving it is not bipartite.  A
certifying algorithm for planarity would return either an embedding of
the graph in a plane, or one of the two Kuratowski subgraphs proving
the input graph is not planar.

A graph is $k$-critical if it is $k$-chromatic but each of its proper
induced subgraphs is $(k-1)$-colorable.  In \cite{BruHoa2009} and also
\cite{MafMor}, a certifying algorithm for $3$-colorability of
$P_5$-free graphs is provided by showing that the number of
$4$-critical $P_5$-free graphs is finite.  Given this result, one may
ask whether the same statement holds for $k$-critical $P_5$-free
graphs for any $k \geq 4$.  However, \cite{HoaMoo2013} shows the
number of $k$-critical $P_5$-free graphs is infinite for $k \geq 5$.
Here we prove that the number of $k$-critical ($P_5,
\overline{P}_5$)-free graphs is finite for every fixed $k$, thereby
establishing a certifying algorithm for $k$-colorability of ($P_5,
\overline{P}_5$)-free graphs.  In section~\ref{sec:definitions}, we
give definitions and background on our problem.  In
section~\ref{sec:characterization}, we give the proofs of our main
results.  In section~\ref{sec:5-critical}, we give the exact number of
$k$-critical {\PP}-free graphs for $k \leq 8$; in particular, we will
construct a list of all 5-critical {\PP}-free graphs.

\section{Definitions and background}\label{sec:definitions}
A $k$-coloring of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a mapping $f: V \rightarrow
\{1,\ldots, k\}$ such that $f(u) \not= f(v)$ whenever $uv \in E$.
Given a coloring, a {\it color class} is the set of all vertices
of the same color.  The chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of a graph $G$
is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ is $k$-colorable.  $G$ is
$k$-chromatic if $\chi(G) = k$.  A graph $G$ is {\em $k$-critical}
if it is $k$-chromatic and none of its proper induced subgraphs is
$k$-chromatic (that is, all of its proper induced subgraphs are
$(k-1)$-colorable).  We say that a graph is {\it critical} if it
is $k$-critical for some $k$.  Let $N(v)$ be the set of neighbors
of $v$. A set $X$ of vertices of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a {\em
module} if for all $v \not\in X$, $X \subseteq N(v)$ or $N(v) \cap
X = \phi$.  Module $X$ is {\em trivial} if $|X| = 1$ or $X = |V|$.
Unless otherwise stated, a module in this paper is non-trivial.  A
vertex of $G$ is {\it universal} if it is adjacent to every other
vertex of $G$. Vertices $u,v$ are comparable if $N(u) \subseteq
N(v)$, or vice versa. If $X$ is a set of vertices of $G$, then
$G[X]$ denotes the subgraph if $G$ induced by $X$.  A set $A$ of
vertices is {\it complete} to a set $B$ of vertices if there are
all edges between $A$ and $B$.  Given two graphs $G$ and $ H$, the
graph $F$ is the {\it join} of $G$ and $H$ if $F$ is obtained by
taking $G$ and $H$ and joining every vertex in $G$ to every vertex
in $H$ by an edge.  As usual, $K_t$ denotes the clique on $t$
vertices; and $C_t$ denotes the induced cycle on $t$ vertices. The
complement of $G$ is denoted by $\overline{G}$.

Let $G$ be a graph with a module $M$, where $M$ needs not be
non-trivial.  Consider the graph $G'$ obtained from $G$ by
removing $M$, adding another graph $H$, and adding all edges
between a vertex $x \in G-M$ and all vertices of $H$ whenever $x$
has a neighbor in $M$ in the graph $G$.  We say that $G'$ is
obtained from $G$ by {\it substituting} $H$ for $M$.  A {\em buoy}
is a graph $B$ obtained from a $C_5$ by, for each vertex $x$ of
the $C_5$, substituting a graph $B_x$ for $x$.  The graph $B_x$ is
a {\em bag} of the buoy.  Thus, the buoy will have $5$ bags, and
we label these $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5$ in the cyclic order.
Without loss of generality, we will start with $B_1$ when
discussing bags.  Note each $B_i$ is a module of $B$.  The buoy
$B$ is {\it full} if $B$ contains all vertices of $G$; $B$ is {\it
universal} if every vertex in $G-B$ is universal; $B$ is a {\it
join buoy} if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to every vertex of
$G-B$.  A \emph{pseudo-buoy} is defined as a buoy except that any
of the sets $B_1, \ldots, B_5$ may be empty.  The following two
lemmas are folklore and are easy to establish.

\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:neighbor}
In a critical graph there do not exist two comparable vertices.
$\Box$
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:connected}
A critical graph is connected. $\Box$
\end{Lemma}
%
The following lemma is also well known and we will rely on it for
our proofs.
\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:cliqueCutset}
A critical graph that is not a clique does not contain a clique
cutset.
\end{Lemma}
{\it Proof.} Let $G$ be a $k$-critical graph with a clique cutset
$C$.  Thus, $G-C$ can be partitioned into two sets $A, B$ such
that there are no edges between $A$ and $B$.  Let $G_A$ (resp.,
$G_B$) be the subgraph of $G$ induced by $C \cup A$ (resp., $C
\cup B$).  Consider a coloring of $G_A$ (resp., $G_B$) with
$\chi(G_A)$ (resp., $\chi(G_B)$) colors.  Since $G$ is critical,
we have $\chi(G_A) < k$ and $\chi(G_B) < k$.  Without loss of
generality, we may assume $\chi(G_A) \geq \chi(G_B)$.  Then a
$\chi(G_A)$-coloring of $G$ can be obtained by identifying the
colors of $G_A$ and $G_B$ on $C$.  But this implies $\chi(G) =
\chi(G_A) < k$, a contradiction. $\Box$

\begin{Lemma}\label{thm:FG}{\rm \cite{FouGia1995}}
Given a $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$--free graph $G$, every $C_5$ of $G$ is
contained in a buoy which is either full or a module of $G$.  $\Box$
\end{Lemma}

Let $\omega(G)$ denotes the {\it clique number} of $G$, ie. the number of vertices in a largest clique of
$G$. A graph $G$ is {\it perfect} if for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$,
we have $\chi(H)=\omega(H)$.
\begin{Observation}\label{obs:perfect}
If $G$ is perfect and $k$-critical,
then $G$ is the graph $K_k$, the clique on $k$ vertices.
\end{Observation}
%
{\it Proof.} Let $G$ be a perfect $k$-critical graph. Thus, we have $\chi(G)=\omega(G)=k$.
For a vertex $v$ of $G$, we have
$\chi(G-v) = k -1$ by definition. Since $G$ is perfect, we have $\omega(G-v)=k-1$. It follows that any largest clique of $G$ must contain $v$. Since $v$ was chosen arbitrarily, a largest clique of $G$ must contain all vertices of $G$, that is, $G$ is a clique on $k$ vertices. $\Box$

We will also need the following result.
\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:CHMW}{\rm \cite{ChvHoa1987}}
$(P_5, \overline{P}_5, C_5)$-free graphs are perfect.  $\Box$
\end{Lemma}

\section{The structure of $k$-critical {\PP}-free
graphs}\label{sec:characterization}
%
In this section, we study properties of maximal buoys in
{\PP}-free graphs and we show that every critical {\PP}-free graph
$G$ can be constructed by two simple operations: (i) $G$ is the
join of two smaller critical graphs, or (ii) $G$ is obtained from
the $C_5$ by substituting some smaller critical graphs for each
vertex on the $C_5$. As a consequence, we obtain a certifying
algorithm for $k$-colorability of {\PP}-free graphs.
%
\subsection{Structural results}

We begin by  establishing a number of preliminary results.
\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:module-critical}
If $G$ is $k$--critical with a non-trivial module $M$, then $M$ is
$\ell$--critical for some $\ell < k$.
%\label{thm:ellcritical}
\end{Lemma}
\noindent {\it Proof}.  As $M$ is a module, we can partition the
vertices of $G$ into three sets: $M$; $N$, the set of vertices in
$G-M$ adjacent to the vertices of $M$; and $R$, the set of
vertices in $G-M$ having no neighbors in $M$.

Let $\chi(M)=\ell$ for some $\ell\leq k$.  If $\ell=k$, then $N$ must
be empty since any color assigned to a vertex in $N$ must be different
from the colors assigned to vertices in $M$ (and so $G$ would require
more than $k$ colors).  This would imply that $G$ is not connected, a
contradiction to Lemma~\ref{lem:connected}.  So, we know $\ell < k$.

Now, we need to  show that $M$ is $\ell$-critical; that is, we must
show that  $M-y$ is $(\ell-1)$-colorable for any vertex $y\in M$.

Suppose on the contrary that there is a vertex $x \in M$ with $\chi(M-x)
= \ell$.  Now consider a $(k-1)$-coloring $\beta$ of the graph $G-x$
which we know must exist because $G$ is $k$-critical.  Then at least
$\ell$ colors of $\beta$ appear in $M-x$, because $\chi (M-x) = \ell$.
Let $C_M$ be the set of colors of $\beta$ that appear in $M$, and let
$C_N$ be the set of colors of $\beta$ that appear in $N$.  We have
$C_M \cap C_N = \emptyset$ since there are all edges between $M$ and
$N$.

Let $\theta$ be an $\ell$-coloring of $M$ that uses the colors of
$C_M$; such a coloring exists because $M$ is $\ell$-colorable. Now
consider an assignment $\gamma$ of colors to $G$ which uses the
same colors for $R$ and $N$ as in $\beta$ but uses the coloring of
$\theta$ for $M$, that is, for a vertex $x$, if $x \in R \cup N$,
then $\gamma(x) = \beta(x)$; and if $x \in M$, then $\gamma(x)=
\theta(x)$. Then $\gamma$ is a valid coloring because for any two
adjacent vertices $x,y$, we have $\gamma(x) \not= \gamma(y)$; in
particular, if $x \in M$ and $y \in N$ then $\gamma(x) \in C_M$
and $\gamma(y) \in C_N$ and so $\gamma(x) \not= \gamma(y)$.  So,
$\gamma$ uses the same number of colors as $\beta$; that is, $G$
is $(k-1)$-colorable, a contradiction. $\Box$

\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:join-critical}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be any graph.  Suppose that $V$ admits a partition into
two non-empty sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that $V_1$ is complete to
$V_2$.  Then $G$ is critical if and only if the two graphs $G[V_1]$
and $G[V_2]$ are critical.
\end{Lemma}
\noindent{\it Proof.} Let $k=\chi(G)$.  Write $G_i=G[V_i]$ for
each $i\in\{1,2\}$.

First suppose that $G$ is $k$-critical.  If $V_i$ is a single vertex
then it is 1-critical; otherwise, $V_i$ is a module of $G$ and so by
Lemma~\ref{lem:module-critical}, $G[V_i]$ is critical.

Now suppose that each of $G_1$ and $G_2$ is critical.  Let $k_1=
\chi(G_1)$ and $k_2= \chi(G_2)$.  So $k=\chi(G)= \chi(G_1)+ \chi(G_2)=
k_1+k_2$.  Pick any $x\in V_1$.  Since $G_1$ is critical, $G_1 - x$
admits a $(k_1-1)$-coloring.  We can combine this coloring with any
$k_2$-coloring of $G_2$, using a disjoint set of colors, to obtain a
$(k-1)$-coloring of $G$.  The same holds if $x\in V_2$.  So $G$ is
critical.  $\Box$

\medskip


\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:substitute-critical}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a $k$-critical graph for some $k$.  Let $M$ be a
module of $G$ with $\chi(M) = \ell$ for some $\ell$.  Let $G'$ be the
graph obtained from $G$ by substituting a clique $K$ on $\ell$
vertices for $M$.  Then $G'$ is also $k$-critical.
\end{Lemma}
{\it Proof.} It is easy to see that $\chi(G') = \chi(G) = k$. We
need to prove that every proper induced subgraph of $G'$ is
$r$-colorable for some $r < k$.  Let $H'$ be a proper induced
subgraph of $G'$.  Let $N$ be the set of vertices of $G$ with some
neighbor in $M$ and let $R = V - N$. With respect to $G'$, the
sets $N$ and $R$ remain unchanged (vertices in $N$ would have
neighbors in $K$).

Suppose some vertex $x$ in $K$ does not belong to $H'$.  Let $t$ be
the number of vertices of $K$ that are in $H'$ with $t < \ell$.  In
$M$, consider an induced subgraph $M_t$ with chromatic number $t$.
Such graph exists since $t < \ell = \chi(M)$.  Consider the subgraph
of $G$ induced by $N \cup R \cup M_t$.  It admits an $r$-coloring
$\alpha$ for some $r < k$.  In this coloring, at least $t$ colors
appear in $M$.  From $\alpha$, we can construct an $r$-coloring of
$H'$ by (i) for $v \in H' \cap (N \cup R)$, giving $v$ the color
$\alpha(v)$, (ii) giving each of the $t$ vertices of $K \cap H'$ a
distinct color used by $\alpha$ on $M$.

Thus, we may assume all vertices of $K$ belong to $H'$.  It follows
that some vertex $x \in N \cup R$ is not in $H'$.  Let $H$ be the
proper induced subgraph of $G$ obtained from $H'$ by substituting $M$
for $K$.  Since $H$ admits an $r$-coloring $\alpha$ for some $r < k$,
we may obtain an $r$-coloring of $H'$ from $\alpha$ by (i) for $v \in
H' \cap (N \cup R)$, giving $v$ the color $\alpha(v)$, (ii) giving
each of the vertices of $K$ a distinct color that $\alpha$ uses on
$M$.  $\Box$

\begin{Observation}\label{obs:substitution}
Let $G$ and $H$ be two  {\PP}-free graph. Suppose $G$ contains  a module $M$.
Let $G'$ be the graph obtained from $G$
by substituting $H$ for $M$. Then $G'$ is {\PP}-free.
\end{Observation}

\noindent {\it Proof.} Let $N$ be the set of vertices of $G-M$
with some neighbours in $M$, and let $R=V(G)-M-N$. Then $V(G') = R
\cup N \cup V(H)$ and $H$ is a module of $G'$. Suppose $G'$
contains a graph $P$ which is isomorphic to a $P_5$ or
$\overline{P}_5$. Observe that $P$ contains no module. For any
vertex $x \in M$ and any vertex $y \in H$, the subgraph $G_x$ of
$G$ induced by $R \cup N \cup \{x\}$ is isomorphic to the subgraph
$G_y'$ of $G'$ induced by $R \cup N \cup \{y\}$. We have $ \left
\vert V(P) \cap H \right \vert \geq 2$, for otherwise $P$ lies
completely in $G_x$ and therefore in $G$, a contradiction. We also
have $V(P) - H \not= \emptyset$, for otherwise $P$ lies entirely
in $H$, a contradiction. But then in $P$, the set $V(P) \cap H$ is
a module, a contradiction. $\Box$




\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:buoy}
Let $G$ be a critical {\PP}-free graph.  If $G$ contains a $C_5$, then  $G$ contains a
full or a join buoy.
\end{Lemma}


\noindent {\it Proof.} The smallest graph with a buoy is the $C_5$
for which the Lemma obviously holds. We now prove the Lemma by
contradiction. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a smallest $k$-critical {\PP}-free
graph without a join or full buoy. Let $B$ be a maximal bouy of
$G$. (Here, ``Maximal'' is meant with respect to set-inclusion.
In particular, a maximal buoy may not be a largest buoy.) By
Theorem~\ref{thm:FG}, we know $B$ is a module of $G$. Let $N$ be
the set of vertices of $G-B$ with some neighbors in $B$ and let $R
= V - N - B$.  We know $R \not= \emptyset$, for otherwise $B$ is a
join buoy, a contradiction.  Let $G'$ be the graph obtained from
$G$ by substituting a clique $K$ on $\chi(B)$ vertices for $B$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:substitute-critical}, we know $G'$ is also
$k$-critical. Note that $K$ is a module of $G'$, and with respect
to $K$ and $G'$, the sets $N$ and $R$ remain unchanged (vertices
in $N$ would have neighbors in $K$). By
Observation~\ref{obs:substitution}, $G'$ is {\PP}-free. The graph
$G'$ is not a clique because there is a non-edge between $R$ and
$K$. By Observation~\ref{obs:perfect}, $G'$ is not perfect. Now,
Lemma~\ref{lem:CHMW} implies $G'$ contains a $C_5$. Note that $G'$
has fewer vertices than $G$ ($B$ has a non-edge but $K$ is a
clique).  The minimality of $G$ implies $G'$ contains a buoy $B'$
that is full or join.

We now prove $K-B' \not= \emptyset$. Suppose $K$ is completely
contained in $B'$. Since $K$ is a module of $G'$, $K$ lies
entirely in one bag of $B'$.  Let $B''$ be the  graph obtained
from $B'$ by substituting $B$ for $K$. Then $B''$ is a buoy of $G$
and strictly contains $B$, a contradiction to the maximality of
$B$. So, $K$ must contain some vertex of $G'-B'$. This implies
$B'$ is not a full buoy of $G'$.

Now, we may assume $B'$ is a join buoy of $G'$, that is, $G'$ can
be partitioned into two set $F_1 = B'$ and $F_2$ such that there
are all edges between $F_1$ and $F_2$.  The clique $K$ cannot
contain a vertex $b$ in $B'$ and and a vertex $a$ in $F_2$ because
some vertex of $B'$ would be non-adjacent to  $b$ and adjacent to
$a$, a contradiction to the assumption that $K$ is a module of
$G'$. Since $K-B' \not= \emptyset$, $K$ lies completely in $F_2$.
But now $B'$ is a join buoy of $G$, a contradiction.  $\Box$

\begin{Lemma}\label{lem:k5}
For an integer $h\ge 0$, let $H$ be any graph that is a pseudo-buoy with
bags $B_1, \ldots, B_5$ such that, for each $i\bmod 5$, $B_i$ is
${k_i}$-colorable, where $k_1, \ldots, k_5$ are integers that satisfy
$k_i+k_{i+1}\le h$ for each $i\bmod 5$.  Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]
If $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i \le 2h$, then $\chi(H)\le h$.
\item[(ii)]
If $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i > 2h$ and each $B_i$ is $k_i$-chromatic, then
$\chi(H) > h$.
\end{itemize}
\end{Lemma}
%
\noindent{\it Proof.} Proof of (i).   We establish property (i) by
induction on $h$.  Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i \le 2h$.  If $h=0$,
the property holds trivially.  Now assume that $h\ge 1$. Suppose
some three bags of $H$ are empty. Then $H$ is disconnected or is
the join of some $B_i$ and $B_{i+1}$ and so $H$ is $h$-colorable
by the lemma's hypothesis. Thus, some three bags of $H$ must be
non-empty. Say that a pair $(i,i+1)$ is \emph{tight} if
$k_i+k_{i+1}=h$.  Say that a pair $(j,j+2)$ is \emph{good}  if
$B_j$ and $B_{j+2}$ are both not empty, and every tight pair
contains an element from $\{j,j+2\}$.

Suppose all five pairs are tight. Then, we have
$5h=\sum_{i=1}^{5}(k_i+k_{i+1})=2\sum_{i=1}^{5}k_i \leq 4h$, which
is impossible. So, there is a non-tight pair. Suppose there is no
good pair. Among all non-tight pairs, choose the pair $(i,i+1)$
such that $k_i + k_{i+1}$ is minimized. We may assume without loss
of generality that $(1,2)$ are such a non-tight pair. If $B_3 =
\emptyset$, then the choice of the pair $(1,2)$ implies $B_1 =
\emptyset$. Now the sets $B_2, B_4, B_5$ are not empty, and so
$(2,4)$ is a good pair, a contradiction. Now we may assume $B_3
\not= \emptyset$, and by symmetry $B_5 \not= \emptyset$. But now
$(3,5)$ is a good pair, a contradiction.

So there is a good pair.  Up to relabelling, assume that $(1,3)$
is a good pair.  Pick any $k_1$-coloring of $B_1$, and let $S'$ be
a color class in that coloring.  Likewise, pick any $k_3$-coloring
of $B_3$, and let $S''$ be a color class in that coloring.  Let
$S=S'\cup S''$ and $H^*=H\setminus S$.  Thus $H^*$ is a
pseudo-buoy with bags $B_1'=B_1\setminus S',\; B_2'= B_2,\; B_3'=
B_3\setminus S'', \; B_4'=B_4, \; B_5'=B_5$.   Let $k_i' =
\chi(B_i')$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,5$. The fact that $(1,3)$ is a good
pair implies that $H^*$ satisfies the induction hypothesis for the
integer $h-1$.  In particular, since $\chi(B_i') \leq k_i -1$ for
$i= 1,3$, we have $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i' \le 2(h-1)$. So $H^*$ is
$(h-1)$-colorable, and consequently $H$ is $h$-colorable since we
may use the $h$-th color on the vertices of~$S$.

Proof of (ii).  Suppose on the contrary that $\chi(H)\le h$.  So the
vertices of $H$ can be partitioned into $h$ stable sets $S_1, \ldots,
S_{h}$.  For each $i\in\{1, \ldots, 5\}$, let $\sigma_i$ be the number
of sets among $S_1, \ldots, S_{h}$ that have non-empty intersection
with $B_i$.  The definition of a pseudo-buoy implies that each stable
set $S_j$ has non-empty intersection with at most two of $B_1, \ldots,
B_5$.  It follows that $\sum_{i=1}^5 \sigma_i\le 2h$.  So
$\sum_{i=1}^5 \sigma_i < \sum_{i=1}^5 k_i$, which implies that there
is an integer $i\in\{1, \ldots, 5\}$ such that $\sigma_i< k_i$.  Hence
the non-empty intersections of $S_1, \ldots, S_{h}$ in $B_i$ form a
coloring of $B_i$ with strictly fewer colors than $k_i$, a
contradiction.  $\Box$

\medskip

Let $\mathcal{C}_k$ be the family of $k$-critical {\PP}-free
graphs. Clearly, $\mathcal{C}_1=\{K_1\}$ and
$\mathcal{C}_2=\{K_2\}$.  In general we have $K_k\in
\mathcal{C}_k$.  We are now in a position to prove the main
theorem of this section.


\begin{Theorem}\label{thm:construction}
For any $k\ge 2$, a graph $G$ is in $\mathcal{C}_k$ if and only if
it can be obtained by any of the following two constructions: \\
--- Construction 1: $G$ is the join of a member of $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}$
and a member of $\mathcal{C}_{k_2}$ for positive integers $k_1$ and
$k_2$ such that $k_1+k_2=k$.  \\
--- Construction 2: $G$ is a buoy with bags $B_1, \ldots, B_5$ such
that, for each $i\bmod 5$, the graph $B_i$ is a member of
$\mathcal{C}_{k_i}$, where $k_1, \ldots, k_5$ are positive integers
that satisfy $k_i+k_{i+1}\le k-1$ for each $i\bmod 5$ and
$\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i = 2k-1$.
\end{Theorem}

\noindent{\it Proof.} Let $k\ge 2$.

(I) We prove that any graph obtained by Construction~1 or~2 is in
$\mathcal{C}_k$.

First suppose that $G$ is obtained by Construction~1, i.e., $G$ is the
join of a member $G_1$ of $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}$ and a member $G_2$ of
$\mathcal{C}_{k_2}$ for positive integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that
$k_1+k_2=k$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:join-critical}, $G$ is $k$-critical.

Now suppose that $G$ is obtained by Construction~2, with the same
notation as in the theorem.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:k5}~(ii) (with
$h=k-1$), we have $\chi(G)\ge k$.  Pick any $x\in B_1$.  We know that
$B_1 - x$ is $(k_1-1)$-colorable.  Moreover, we have
$(k_1-1)+\sum_{i=2}^5 k_i=2(k-1)$.  So the graph $G - x$, which is the
buoy with bags $B_1 - x, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5$, satisfies the hypothesis
of Lemma~\ref{lem:k5}~(i) with $h=k-1$, and consequently it is
$(k-1)$-colorable.  The same holds for every vertex $x$ in $G$.  This
implies that $\chi(G)=k$ and $G$ is $k$-critical.

(II) Now we prove the converse part of the theorem.  Let $G=(V,E)$ be
a member of $\mathcal{C}_k$, i.e., $G$ is $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free
and $k$-critical.  If $\overline{G}$ is not connected, then we can
apply Lemma~\ref{lem:join-critical}, and it follows that $G$ is
obtained by Construction~1.  Therefore assume that $\overline{G}$ is
connected.  Thus $G$ is not a clique and by Observation~\ref{obs:perfect} and
Lemma~\ref{lem:CHMW}, $G$
contains a $C_5$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:buoy}, $G$ contains a buoy $B$ which is  full or join.

Suppose $B$ is a join buoy of $G$.  Consider the set $A= V -B$.  Since
$A$ is complete to $B$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:join-critical}, both $A$ and
$B$ are critical, and so $G$ is obtained by Construction~2.

So, we may assume $B$ is a full buoy, that is, it contains all
vertices of $G$.  Let the bags of $B$ be $B_1, \ldots, B_5$.  Let
$k_i=\chi(B_i)$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots, 5\}$.  For each $i$ we must
have $k_i+k_{i+1}\le k-1$, for otherwise $\chi(G[B_i\cup B_{i+1}])=k$,
which contradicts the fact that $G$ is $k$-critical.  Also we must
have $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i \ge 2k-1$, for otherwise, by
Lemma~\ref{lem:k5}~(i), $G$ is $(k-1)$-colorable.  Each $B_i$ (with at
least two vertices) is a module of $G$, and so by
Lemma~\ref{lem:module-critical}, $B_i$ is $k_i$-critical.  Suppose
that $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i \ge 2k$.  Pick any $x\in V$.  Then $G - x$ is a
pseudo-buoy that satisfies Lemma~\ref{lem:k5}~(ii), so $\chi(G - x)
\geq k$, which contradicts the fact that $G$ is $k$-critical.  So we
have $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i = 2k-1$.  This shows that $G$ can be obtained
by Construction~2.  $\Box$

\begin{Theorem}\label{thm:finite}
For every $k$, $\mathcal{C}_k$ is a finite set.
\end{Theorem}
{\it Proof.} By induction on $k$. When $k=3$, it is easy to see
$\mathcal{C}_3$ contains two graphs: the $C_3$ and $C_5$ (every
graph $G$ in $\mathcal{C}_3$ must contain an odd cycle, and if $G$
does not contain $C_3$ or $C_5$, then $G$ contains an odd
chordless cycle with at least seven vertices and thus a $P_5$.)
Let $\mathcal{J}_k$ be the set of graphs of ${\cal C}_k$
constructed by Construction 1. Let $\mathcal{B}_k$ be the set of
graphs of $\mathcal{C}_k$ constructed by Construction 2. We have
$\mathcal{C}_k = \mathcal{J}_k \cup \mathcal{B}_k$ by
Theorem~\ref{thm:construction}.  Let $f(k)$ (respectively, $j(k)$,
$b(k)$) be the cardinality of $\mathcal{C}_k$ (respectively,
${\cal J}_k$, $\mathcal{B}_k$). Each graph in $\mathcal{J}_k$ is
constructed by taking the join of a graph in $\mathcal{C}_i$ and a
graph in ${\cal C}_{k-i}$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$.  It follows
that $j(k) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} f(i) f(k-i)$.  Consider a graph
$G$ in ${\cal B}_k$ which is a full buoy.  Graph $G$ has five
bags, each of which is a graph of $\mathcal{C}_i$ with $i \leq
k-2$.  It follows that $b(k) \leq (f(k-2))^5$.  Since $f(k) = j(k)
+ b(k)$, we have $f(k) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} f(i) f(k-i) +
(f(k-2))^5$.  So $f(k)$ is a function in $k$ and the result
follows.

For completeness, we will give a bound for $f(k)$ using Knuth's
up-arrow notation.  Define a single up-arrow operation to be $a
\uparrow b = a^b$.  Next define a double arrow operation to be $a
\uparrow \uparrow b = a \uparrow (a \uparrow (\ldots \uparrow a))$,
that is, a tower of $b$ copies of $a$.  It is easy to prove by
induction that $f(k) \leq 5 \uparrow \uparrow k$.

\subsection{A certifying algorithm for $k$-colorability of $(P_5,
\overline{P}_5)$-free graphs}

The algorithm in \cite{HoaLaz2013} accepts as input any graph $G$
that is $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free and determines whether $G$ is
$k$-colorable in time $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices of $G$.  However, when $G$ is not $k$-colorable, the
algorithm does not produce an easily verifiable certificate for a
``NO'' answer.

Now, given a $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free graph $G$, we have a
simple polynomial-time algorithm for finding a $k$-critical
induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, as follows.  Consider a vertex $x$,
and determine if $G\setminus x$ is $k$-colorable; if it is not
$k$-colorable, then we remove $x$ from consideration; if it is
$k$-colorable, then $x$ is in~$H$.  Repeat the process for all
other vertices. The vertices that have not been removed from
consideration form the desired graph $H$. Now it is easy to check
whether $H$ satifies the properties given in
Theorem~\ref{thm:construction}, because, by
Theorem~\ref{thm:finite}, there is only a finite number of
$k$-critical graphs.  So it takes constant time to check whether
$H$ belongs to the family $\mathcal{C}_k$ of $k$-critical graphs.



\section{$k$-critical $(P_5, \overline{P}_5)$-free graphs for small
$k$}\label{sec:5-critical}

By Theorem~\ref{thm:finite} the number of $k$-critical {\PP}-free
graphs is finite for every $k$.  In this section, we will refine the
argument to establish sharp bounds on $|\mathcal{C}_k|$ for small
values of $k$.  In particular, we will construct all 5-critical
{\PP}-free graphs.

Let classes $\mathcal{B}_k$ and $\mathcal{J}_k$ be defined as in
Theorem~\ref{thm:finite}.  Recall that $\mathcal{C}_1=\{K_1\}$, ${\cal
C}_2=\{K_2\}$ and $\mathcal{C}_3=\{K_3, C_5\}$, so
$\mathcal{B}_1={\cal B}_2=\emptyset$ and $\mathcal{B}_3=\{C_5\}$.

When $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are two sets of graphs, let
${\cal A}\otimes\mathcal{B}$ be the set of graphs that are the join of
a member of $\mathcal{A}$ and a member of $\mathcal{B}$.  We know that
$\mathcal{J}_k = \bigcup_{k_1+k_2=k} \mathcal{C}_{k_1}\otimes {\cal
C}_{k_2}$.  This means that each member $G$ of $\mathcal{J}_k$ is
either the join of several buoys or the join of $K_p$ and a member of
$\mathcal{C}_{k-p}$ for some positive $p$; in the latter case $G$ is
also the join of $K_1$ and a member of $\mathcal{C}_{k-1}$.  It
follows that we can write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Jk}
\mathcal{J}_k = (\mathcal{C}_1\otimes \mathcal{C}_{k-1}) \cup (\bigcup
\mathcal{B}_{k_1}\otimes \cdots\otimes \mathcal{B}_{k_p})
\end{equation}
where the union is over all vectors $(k_1, \ldots, k_p)$ such that
$k_1+\cdots+k_p=k$ and $k_i\ge 3$.

When $G$ is a member of $\mathcal{B}_k$ we associate with $G$ its
\emph{pattern}, which is the numerical vector $(k_1, \ldots, k_5)$
(with the same notation as in Theorem~\ref{thm:construction}) that
satisfies the~constraints $k_i>0$, $k_i+k_{i+1}\le k-1$ for each
$i\bmod 5$ and $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i = 2k-1$.  Several non-isomorphic
members of $\mathcal{B}_k$ can have the same pattern.  Conversely,
given a pattern $(k_1, \ldots, k_5)$ that satisfies the constraints,
one can construct a member of $\mathcal{B}_k$ as a buoy $(B_1, \ldots,
B_5)$ where $B_i$ is chosen from $\mathcal{C}_{k_i}$ for each $i$, and
Theorem~\ref{thm:construction} says that every member of
$\mathcal{B}_k$ is constructed that way (different choices may yield
the same member of $\mathcal{B}_k$ due to isomorphism).  We illustrate
this for the values $k=4$, $k=5$ and $k=6$.

For $k=4$, the only pattern that satisfies the constraints
$k_i>0$, $k_i+k_{i+1}\le 3$ for each $i\bmod 5$ and $\sum_{i=1}^5
k_i = 7$ is, up to circular permutation, $(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)$.  The
corresponding member of $\mathcal{B}_4$ is graph $T_3$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:4critical}.  By (\ref{eq:Jk}), we have
$\mathcal{J}_4 = \mathcal{C}_1\otimes \mathcal{C}_3$, so the
members of $\mathcal{J}_4$ are the graphs $T_1$ and $T_2$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:4critical}.  Hence $|\mathcal{C}_4|=3$.

\ldots, F_9$, the ovals represent the bags and the double line denotes
all edges between the two bags.}\label{fig:list}
\end{figure}
%

For $k=5$, the patterns that satisfy the constraints $k_i>0$,
$k_i+k_{i+1}\le 4$ for each $i\bmod 5$ and $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i = 9$ are,
up to circular permutation, $(2, 2, 2, 2, 1)$, $(2, 1, 3, 1, 2)$ and
$(1, 3, 1, 3, 1)$.  Pattern $(2,2,2,2,1)$ yields the graph $F_4$ on
Figure~\ref{fig:list}.  Since $\mathcal{C}_3=\{K_3, C_5\}$, pattern
$(2, 1, 3, 1, 2)$ yields graphs $F_5$ and $F_6$, and pattern
$(1,3,1,3,1)$ yields graphs $F_7$, $F_8$ and $F_9$.  So
$|\mathcal{B}_5|=6$.  By (\ref{eq:Jk}), we have $\mathcal{J}_5 = {\cal
C}_1\otimes \mathcal{C}_{4}$, so $\mathcal{J}_5$ consists of graphs
$F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$ on Figure~\ref{fig:list}.  Hence $|{\cal C}_5|=9$.

For $k=6$, the patterns that satisfy the constraints $k_i>0$,
$k_i+k_{i+1}\le 5$ for each $i\bmod 5$ and $\sum_{i=1}^5 k_i = 11$
are, up to circular permutation, $(2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$, $(2,3,2,3,1)$,
$(2,3,1,3,2)$, $(1,4,1,3,2)$ and $(1,4,1,4,1)$.  Since $|{\cal
C}_1|=1$, $|\mathcal{C}_2|=1$, $|\mathcal{C}_3|=2$ and
$|\mathcal{C}_4|=3$, we see that $(2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$ yields two graphs,
$(2,3,2,3,1)$ yields four graphs, $(2,3,1,3,2)$, yields three graphs,
$(1,4,1,3,2)$ yields six graphs, and $(1,4,1,4,1)$ yields, up to
symmetry, six graphs.  So $|\mathcal{B}_6|=21$.  By (\ref{eq:Jk}), we
have $\mathcal{J}_6 = (\mathcal{C}_1\otimes \mathcal{C}_{5})\cup
({\cal B}_3\otimes \mathcal{B}_3)$, so $|\mathcal{J}_6|=9+1=10$.
Hence $|{\cal C}_6|=31$.

Similar computations lead to $|\mathcal{C}_7|=185$ and $|{\cal
C}_8|=1487$.
