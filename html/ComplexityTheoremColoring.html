	Four Types of graph Classification:
	<br/>
	<strong>Type A</strong> graphs containing cycles<br/>
	<strong>Type B</strong> graphs containing a claw<br/>
	<strong>Type C</strong> graphs containing an induced copy of a spanning subgraph of 2K2<br/>
	<strong>Type D</strong> graphs wich are induced subgraph of P4 or of co-paw<br/>
	<strong>Proposition 2.</strong> Let A be a finite set of graphs.
	<ol>
		<li>
			If at least one of the graphs of A is of type D then A-FREE COLRING is polynomially solvable
		</li>
		<li>
			If all graphs of A are of the same type A or B or C, then A-FREE COlORING is NP-Complete
		</li>
	</ol>
